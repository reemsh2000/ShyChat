# ShyChat

## Live demo :tv:  [link](https://shychatapp.herokuapp.com/)

## Problem :memo: 
A lot of people are afraid of someone seeing their private messages on social media.

--------
## Solution :bulb:

We came up with the idea of creating a simple chat app that enables the user to communicate with anyone who has his/her mobile number, without anyone being able to see their conversation.

---------------
## User Story  :books: 

> User
* As a user, you can sign up.
* As a user, you can log in.
* As a user, you can add your information to your profile.
* As a user, you can add edit your profile.
* As a user, you can contact with anyone with his number.
--------------------------
## User journey  :open_book:
The user will enter the site and will login or signup,Hi/She will be able to chat with anyone who owns his/her number and no one is informed of their own messages, In addition to that he/she can create his/her profile and edit it .
